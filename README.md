Notebooks contains the notebooks used to perform the machine learning scalability experiments.
- `Preprocessing Felix` contains all the preprocessing and exploratory steps and initial set up for the experiment with number of variables. Here, also the code for creating the plot is defined.
- `Big Data_ Data preprocessing_Rows` applies these pre-processing steps as well, and perfomrs the experiment with a varying number of records.
- `used cars_Krish_preprocessingv0` applies these pre-processing steps as well and then performs the experiment with a varying number of variables.

Notebooks/old include some exploratory notebooks.
